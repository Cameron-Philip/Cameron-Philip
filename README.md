Currently an MSc Financial Engineering student at the University of Birmingham, transitioning from a background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I am looking to specialise in Quantitative Trading/Research and Market Making, applying rigorous mathematical modelling to market microstructure.

My transition from Engineering to Finance was driven by a fascination with signal processing and optimisation. I enjoy applying the deterministic logic of control systems to the stochastic nature of financial markets. This passion led me to my current focus: exploring the tension between theoretical probability (Martingales, Stochastic Calculus) and the practical realities of risk management (Stopping Times, Drawdown Limits).

Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Analyst Intern and Incubation Analyst at Trireme Market Maker in the Web3 space. There, I gained exposure to the chaotic nature of crypto liquidity. I built Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to forecast Bitcoin market regimes and developed volume prediction models using Random Forest and XGBoost for new token listings. This role bridged the gap for me between data science and actionable market making strategies.

During my undergraduate degree, I was the Lead Quantitative Analyst for the Quantitative Finance Society, where I organised partnerships with J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. My First-Class dissertation focused on Financial Time-Series Analysis, comparing Deep Learning models (LSTMs/GRUs) against classical econometric models (GARCH/ARIMA) for volatility forecasting.

My current research interests lie in Stochastic Processes and High-Frequency Trading. I am currently working on a computational essay regarding the "Pathwise vs. Ensemble" perspectives in Martingales, exploring how the Arc Sine Law affects regime risk in fair markets.

Technical Stack: Python (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch), C++, MATLAB, SQL.
